# Steps To Follow When Answering A Coding Problem 

## 1. Example

- A basic example
- Make sure you clearly understand the problem & requirements
  
## 2. Solutions 

- Start with a brute force solution
- Discuss solutions
- Trade offs / cons and pros 
- Time, space complexity

## 3. Test Cases 

- Edge cases
- Base cases 
- Regular cases 
- Be careful of circular or infinite loops 
  - Visited unvisited to solve this
  - Could use a hash to keep track of visited/unvisited
  - Recursion is often good

## 4. Code

- Confirm function signature and return types
- Handle invalid input
- Use helper functions

## 5. Verify 

- Start with regular case
- Check edge cases
