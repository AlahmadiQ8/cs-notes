## Grading Guidelines

Taqwa was able to independently reach solutions beyond the brute force ones and implement them correctly with minimal hints.
They also covered various cases, walked through her code with an example, identified and fixed minor bugs.
While discussing her solutions, Taqwa described the pros and cons for each.
They were able to write full syntactically correct code within a short amount of time. They clearly demonstrated fluency in her language of choice (Java).
What stood out is that they put TODO comments to check for cases later.
Taqwa's thoughts were clearly translated into code with minimal difficulty. Code was easily readable.
Taqwa understands the pros and cons of different data structures such as Sets and Hashmaps.
Taqwa was very determined to solve the problem correctly. They easily picked up my minor hints to finish or fix their solutions.


Noor did an excellent job. Me and Noor worked on one problem and moved to the next smoothly. Through all three problems, Noor independantly reached to the most optimal solution with very minimal hints from me.

Through each problem, Noor clearly walked me through the various approaches starting the the brute force and ending the the most optimal solution.
Noor translated her thoughts into clear, easy to follow, and correct syntax code.
Noor demonstrated fluency in her language of choice (Java). She leveraged different data structures to implement her solutions.
Noor ended each solution with walking me through the code line by line with an example input. We cought small bugs that she immediately recognized and fixed. I thought that went really well and showed her attnetion to detail.
Noor was very quick to pick up my hint when I recognized a small mistake. I rarely have to elaborate and clarify more.

asked about range of numbers
brute force solution
*** incorrect time complexity at first but immediately recognizewd the mistaker and fixed it
described a better approach and walked me through it
described the third approach
very clear in walking me through her thought process before
walked witrh me through example
wrote clean code that directly translate her thought process and the approach we discussed with no ambiguityt
walked through her code and recognized bugs with very little hints from me and immediately fixed them
